# Dynamic-Customer-Lifetime-Value-CLV-Optimization
 Instead of just segmenting customers once, I will combine RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis with behavioral clustering (e.g., product categories purchased, time of day, device used).I will build a simple probabilistic model (like a Gamma-Gamma model) to predict Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) for each segment.
